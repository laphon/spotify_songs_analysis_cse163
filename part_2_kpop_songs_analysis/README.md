*********************************************************************

1. kpop_songs_analysis.py

This .py module was written based on Altair package so you need
to download the Altair and supporting packages on pip or conda.

Run this module to create data visualizations of kpop songs features and
its comparison to all Spotify songs using the datasets from folder "source_files".
All the results will be put in folders "part_2.1" and "part_2.2".

2. kpop_test.py
This is the test module for kpop_songs_analysis.py

Run this module to produce test results with smaller datasets from folder "test_datasets".
All the test results will be put in folder "test_results".

3. spotify_api.py & kpop_dataset_with_api.py
These additional modules are not relevant in reproducing visualizations anymore.
There is no need to run these modules.
These datasets were used by us to generate necessary datasets.
