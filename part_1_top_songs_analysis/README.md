CSE163 Final Project Part 1 Top Songs Analysis README:

*********************************************************************

1. top_songs_analysis.py

This .py module was written based on Altair package so you need
to download the Altair and supporting packages on pip or conda.

To run this file you will need to have two csv files downloaded,
for here I uploaded two files already, but just in case, I will
specify on how to download two files on Kaggle website.

Since this file will generate two sets of htmls containing the
charts, you need to create two folders first, one is called
"Part1-1" and one is "Part1-2" or you will receive an error says
directory not found.

2. top_songs_analysis_test.py

This is the test module for the top_songs_analysis.py so you need
to have top_songs_analysis.py in the same folder and Altair & Pandas
packages with two required csv files downloaded.

This module will generate testing charts to a folder called "Tests"
so you need to create a new folder if it does not exist. Otherwise
you will receive the same error in the first part.
